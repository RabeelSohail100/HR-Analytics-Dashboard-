# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-
📊 So here is the another dashboard of Power Bi. Actually Currently am working as a HR Recruiter So This HR Analytics Dashboard Idea came from that.

💡Am Working On this for few days and It includes all the parameters which comes in my mind I put on here It doesn't include any tutorial. I fetch the Data from an unknown resource which looks terrible in a first look then I Clean the Data First Through Microsoft Excel then Make this insightful through Power Bi.

🔗 Parameters That I convered :

 🍩 New Joiners of last 3 months (Donut Chart) :  Which I make through a DAX measure and calculated table   
✨ ( One of my Colleague have Query about this to solve with DAX that's Why I put here)

📈 Cumulative Headcount (Line Graph) : It includes some various DAX to count the strength Date Wise till Current Date.

🌌Qualification Vs Salaries (Scattered Chart) : I make a presentable chart to show Every Employee Salary Comparison with their Qualification.

📊 Highest & Lowest Salary Holders : Showed Difference With Clustered Bar Chart.

⏳EOMONTH Date Wise Parameter (Slicer) : I put a Start to End Date Slicer to Obtain last Months or Parameter wise  Staff Data in a Tabular Form.
